Global GDP Analysis with visualization ->
​This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of global GDP trends. By leveraging pandas for data processing and Plotly for interactive visualizations, this project automates the entire analytical workflow from calculating GDP growth to generating and saving dynamic graphs for hundreds of countries.
​
Project Highlights ->
​This project is a showcase of a complete data analysis pipeline, demonstrating proficiency in:

i) ​ Data Acquisition and Cleaning: The ability to load, inspect, and prepare raw data for analysis.
​ii) Feature Engineering: Calculating the GDP growth rate as a new feature to derive deeper insights from the dataset.
​iii) Automated Visualization: Using loops and functions to programmatically generate and save a large number of interactive plots.
​iv)  Interactive Data Exploration: Creating visualizations that allow users to drill down into the data, providing a more intuitive and insightful experience than static charts.
​v)  Scalable Solutions: The code is designed to handle and process data for numerous countries efficiently, demonstrating a scalable approach to data visualization.
​Core Components

​The project is structured into several key stages to ensure a logical and reproducible analysis:
​1. Data Preparation -
​The initial phase involves loading the GDP dataset using pandas. A key step is the calculation of the GDP growth rate for each country across consecutive years. This derived metric is essential for understanding economic performance and trends over time.
​2. Individual Country Analysis -
​An automated script generates a unique, interactive line graph for each country in the dataset. These graphs are saved as HTML files, making them easy to share and view without requiring a specific software environment.
​3. Cross-Country Comparison -
​This component focuses on comparing the GDP growth of multiple countries on a single plot. The graph is designed to be interactive, allowing for a side-by-side analysis of different economies. This is particularly useful for comparing countries like India and China, or for analyzing regional economic trends.
​4. Bulk Processing -
​A key feature of this project is its ability to handle large datasets. The scripts are built to iterate through all countries, automating the generation and saving of all relevant graphs, showcasing an efficient and scalable approach to data visualization.
